## TODO

- comparison diff is reversed :(
- events renderer
- ! event Link fields dont have type set
- special fields callout (neighbors, events, metrics)
  - or at least make them collapsible, scrollable, something
  - or move them down below details
- speedometer or flux capacitor animation
- look at `exists` and do stuff
- blacklist fields from generating diffs
- revised fields in timeline *
- nicely diff array values *
- store/load selected snapshot state in URL *
- if a field is present but has no value the label is rendered, but no value
